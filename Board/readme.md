# LoRa-Messenger – ESP32 & RA-02
##### Board


To use code from this repository you do not have to make this board, you can modify it, make your own or even make a DIY board or just connect the module to the ESP32 by wires, but if you want a clean finished product, I suggest ordering the board. 

You can use services like PCBWay or EasyEDA to develop your board for only few euros, shipping included, just send them the greber file, select few options, pay and that is it.

All files needed for continuing development or ordering are in your arms reach.
